# Cisco Cloud Operations Bot (CCOB)

Building on our FY19Q4 submission, Merakisight, we wanted to expand the reach of our original platform to integrate with Cisco's ever-growing number of cloud offerings. The initial aim of Merakisight was to allow our users from IT Admins to C-level positions to gain quick insight into the status of their IT assets. With our new project, Cisco Cloud Operations Bot we plan to bring health information from Cisco's security products such Cisco Defense Orchestrator and Cisco Umbrella into a single Webex Team's chatbot to addon to the existing monitoring of Intersight and Meraki.


## Business/Technical Challenge

The idea for Cisco Cloud Operations Bot initially began from our experiences with the Intersight, Umbrella, and Meraki dashboards. We've seen that Cisco has been moving rapidly toward consolidation of its offerings into cloud-based platforms. However, the benefits of these tools are still segmented by their individual architectures. This means that customers who are bought into the Cisco vision of single pane of glass management for all their Cisco products still have to login to each portal individually in order to get an insight into the overall health of their environment.

## Proposed Solution


Cisco Cloud Operations Bot is a solution that further extends Cisco's vision for unified cloud-based visibility and the benefits that customers gain by going all-in with Cisco! We accomplish this by providing a Webex Teams bot that has access to the cloud-based management portals for Umbrella, Meraki, Intersight, and CDO. This bot provides a unified overall concept of "health" and displays it in regularly scheduled messages. These messages are configurable per the user's desired timings and thresholds. In the event that the health of the environment is below the configured threshold, quick access links into the management portals will be provided for agile troubleshooting.
